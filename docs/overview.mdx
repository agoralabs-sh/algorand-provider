## Introduction

Algorand provider is an interface that bridges the gap between dApps and wallets, allowing dApps to connect and interact with wallets in a standardized way.

Algorand provider works towards achieving three main goals:

1. Creating a common interface between dApps and wallets.
2. Allowing wallets to work in unison (the `window.algorand` object should be shared).
3. Allowing dApps to choose what wallet to use.

## How it works

At its core, [`AlgorandProvider`](api-reference/algorand-provider) is instantiated by wallets and assigned to the global `window.algorand` object within each tab. The allows dApps to interact with a wallet using a common interface.

Algorand provider has also been designed in a way to allow for more than one wallet to occupy the `window.algorand` object and give the dApp; the user, the choice of what wallet to interact with.
